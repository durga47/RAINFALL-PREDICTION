# RAINFALL-PREDICTION
Weather Pattern Analysis and Advanced Rainfall Prediction for Optimal Resource
Allocation
"In the context of climate change and its unpredictable effects on local weather patterns,
accurate weather forecasting becomes paramount for sectors like agriculture, water resource
management, and urban planning.
Using the provided dataset:
Do the following,
1. Rainfall Prediction:
Develop a machine learning model to predict the 'RainTomorrow' label based on historical and
current weather metrics. The model should consider features such as temperature, humidity,
wind speed, and direction to forecast rainfall events.
2. Feature Importance and Sensitivity Analysis:
After training the rainfall prediction model, identify which weather metrics are the most influential
in predicting rainfall. Additionally, conduct a sensitivity analysis to understand how slight
changes in key metrics (e.g., 'Pressure 9am', 'Humidity 3pm') impact the prediction outcome.
3. Anomaly Detection:
Develop a model to detect anomalies in the weather data, such as sudden spikes in
temperature or unexpected drops in pressure, which might indicate extreme weather events or
data collection errors.
4. Weather Pattern Clustering:
Use unsupervised learning models to cluster days based on their weather profiles. Identify
patterns or groups of days with similar weather characteristics, which can be used for
comparative analysis and understanding seasonal variations.
5. Missing Data Imputation:
Given the presence of 'NA' values in the dataset, design a model to predict and impute missing
data points, ensuring a more complete dataset for accurate predictions.
6. Wind Pattern Analysis:
- Model the relationship between different wind-related metrics ('WindGustDir',
'WindGustSpeed', 'WindDir9am', 'WindDir3pm') to predict potential gusty days which might have
implications for sectors like aviation and renewable energy.
7. Evaporation Rate Prediction:
Using available metrics, develop a model to predict 'Evaporation' rates, assisting in water
resource management and agricultural planning.
8. Location-based Analysis:
Segment and analyze weather patterns based on 'Location'. Predict how weather patterns might
vary across different locations and identify regions more prone to extreme weather events.
The objective is to harness the power of data to provide actionable weather predictions and
insights, emphasizing the importance of data-driven decision-making in sectors affected by
weather patterns."
